# keechma-color-panels

This example shows the same app mounted twice in the same page. In one case it's using the `:history` router and in another case it's using the `:hashchange` router. The apps are completely isolated and independent. Although this example is contrived and not too useful, it shows what is possible when the framework doesn't depend on any shared global state.
